# Password_Generator
I have built a Strong Password Generator App With Tkinter and Python.

# Description
I have generated a strong password using Pythonâ€™s built-in ability to convert numbers to ASCII characters using the chr() function. 
I generated a random number between 33 and 126 and then converted that to ASCII to create a strong password.
